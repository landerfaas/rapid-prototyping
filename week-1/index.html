## Week 1 - Precedents

My group first looked into retrofittin bicycles in a more renewable fashion. Specific methods of doing this we thought of included solar powered bikes that can charge phones and bikes with regenerative breaking. After first looking into these ideas, we then expanded to think about using solar power for other end uses, specifically for more passive uses where consumers don't have to actively make the switch to renewables. We first thought of things like vending machines or water fountains, but there are likely other things we have yet to consider. We also talked about using sewer water or other types of waste water for hydroelectric power and using trash from landfills for biofuel. Compost to generate heat was also mentioned.
