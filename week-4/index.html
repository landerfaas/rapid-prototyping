## Week 4
  
This week, we continued brainstorming and then each team of the 3 teams presented their first pin-ups of the semester. 

The pin-up for energy storage team can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L8QO2hFe0YEIImoED_7eao3nOXle57VCv-ufpZuIcac/edit#slide=id.p)


As seen within our slides, we have primarily been focusing on narrowing down whether sensible, latent, or thermochemical heat storage makes the most sense for our applications. Latent heat makes the most sense, and already has some precedence in solar cooking. Choosing the optimal material to use in our latent heat system is still a process underway, although sodium potassium nitrate eutactics have promise.



After listening to each of the other groupâ€™s presentation, we got a better sense of what to design our energy storage system for, and what constraints to operate under. The cooker should operate with a max temperature of 400-450 F, and options to cook at lower temperatures (ie. 200) at a sear. Furthermore, the cooker should also have different sections at different temperatures so that the user can easily shift between various cooking styles to suit their needs. Whether or not this will be done via a continuous grate type system or something with multiple separate areas remains to be seen.

	
Moving forward, we must also begin to consider how big our storage system will be (specifically for example, the mass of the storage material in our latent system), the corrosiveness of the material, as well as potential issues regarding thermal expansion.
