## Week 2


My group first looked into retrofitting bicycles in a more renewable fashion. Specific methods of doing this we thought of included solar powered bikes that can charge phones and bikes with regenerative breaking.
After first looking into these ideas, we then expanded to think about using solar power for other end uses, specifically for more passive uses where consumers don't have to actively make the switch to renewables. We first thought of things like vending machines or water fountains, where solar energy could potentially directly power these uses. Integration of solar into other aspects of infrastructure (ie. buildings, airports, parks, areas providing shade, sound barriers, etc [1]). One article I read also discussed building battery systems into concrete infrastructure in order to make buildings that act as giant batteries [2]. A swiss start-up had a different take on using concrete as an energy storage method comparable to pumped hydro, by using cranes to pick up and drop concrete blocks to store potential energy [3].
 We also talked about using sewer water or other types of grey water or waste water for hydroelectric power and using trash from landfills for biofuel. One feasibility study in Japan discussed how using wastewater to generate electricity could pose issues for turbines because if the water is not filtered properly, larger particles could damage the turbines [4].
