## Week 3

After further discussing potential directions we could proceed with on Monday, our class chose what our final overarching project will focus on. Specifically, we will be designing a renewable energy powered cooking device able to cook on demand for users. What we choose to prepare remains to be seen further, although we discussed both grilling and hot beverage preparation. 

Our next steps  have included dividing into 4 teams : cooking, design integration, energy capture, and energy storage. Furthermore, we have the following research questions, among others. 
<ul>
	<li> What is the precedence for on demand cooking devices? </li>
	<li> What are useful temperature ranges of operation? </li>
	<li> How do we control the delivery of heat? </li>
</ul>
Within the energy storage team, we first discussed using sensible heat storage methods like using water tanks. Along similar lines, we also discussed using materials that can be heated to even higher temperatures, like molten salts. We are also interested in phase change materials, or in using PEM hydrogen fuel cells.
